## ‚ú® What's Here?

This repository serves as a personal collection of my early programming projects. It's a great place to explore:

* **Core Concepts:** Simple examples of variables, loops, functions, and user interaction.
* **MATLAB to Python:** Demonstrations of how to translate common MATLAB logic into Python.

---

## üìÅ Included Scripts:

* **`BasicCalculations.py`**: Handles basic arithmetic and geometric calculations.
* **`Celsius2Fahrenheit.py`**: An interactive program to convert temperatures with error handling.
* **`triangle.py`**: A script that draws an inverted asterisk triangle.
* *Add your new script descriptions here...*
